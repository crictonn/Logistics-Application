# Pick a base image to serve as the foundation for the other build stages in
# this file.
#
# For illustrative purposes, the following FROM command
# is using the alpine image (see https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine).
# By specifying the "latest" tag, it will also use whatever happens to be the
# most recent version of that image when you build your Dockerfile.
# If reproducability is important, consider using a versioned tag
# (e.g., alpine:3.17.2) or SHA (e.g., alpine@sha256:c41ab5c992deb4fe7e5da09f67a8804a46bd0592bfdf0b1847dde0e0889d2bff).
